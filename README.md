Overview of Shopping List app:
The Shopping List application allows the user to create a shopping list, which inclues:
the item name, quantity and the cost. The quantity and cost create a sub-total column. 
There is a delete feature.

SwiftUI features included in Shopping List include:
Swift Data
Navigation Stack, Vertical Stack, Horizontal Stack, ForEach, List, TextView, TextField
Picker, Save Button, @State, @Query, function (Delete row from List), Divider, Spacer

Future Work:
vars newPrice and newSubTotal need to be optional. Corresponding properties in Item Class need to reflect this change.
The reason is that user will not know this when making the list at home.
Sub-totals will need to be added up to keep an overall total for the list. This should include sales tax.
